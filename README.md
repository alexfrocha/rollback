### Hey guys, how y'all doing? I hope you are well, as you can see this is not a text generated by ChatGPT or other artificial intelligence.

I'm here to show you how I've been storing information like article links, even gmail accounts and other things, the initial motivation for creating it was so that my friend and I could have a platform where we would store our personal information instead to do tricks like sending a dm to a bot on discord like Loritta

You can test it <a href="https://rollback-e8zs.onrender.com/">clicking here</a> and watch me using it <a href="">here</a>.

### Our dialogue
> **You:** Hey alex the platform is very slow, f*** that. </br>
> **Me:** yoo man chill, lemme explain to you... I'm using a free cloud service, it's <a href="https://render.com/">**render**</a> and take a look in this warning message: </br>

### The continuation of our friendly dialogue
> **You:** Oh man, sorry about that, pardon me </br>
> **Me:** Nah, don't worry that's fine, be happy man, life is good </br>
> **Me:** and i made a cron-job to bypass that, but don't tell to nobdy
